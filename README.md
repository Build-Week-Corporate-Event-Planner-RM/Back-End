## Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the "bread and butter" of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you'll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
